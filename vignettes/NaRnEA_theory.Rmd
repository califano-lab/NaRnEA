This vignette outlines the theory underlying Non-parametric Analytical Rank-based Enrichment Analysis.

### Gene Expression Profiles

In order to develop the theory of gene set analysis we will consider two hypothetical and biologically distinct phenotypes; we will refer to these as the test phenotype and the reference phenotype.

We may define the gene expression profile of the ith sample as the real-valued vector $(x_1,...,x_G)_i$ such that $x_gi$ is the relative molar concentration of stuff.

Here we've included a figure of how this would look:

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "very_specific_figure_name.png", dpi = 1000)
